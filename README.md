# ⚠️⚠️DEPRECATED - NO LONGER MAINTAINED⚠️⚠️
This repository is no longer maintained by the SoundCloud team due to capacity constraints. We're instead focusing our efforts on improving the API & the developer platform. Please note, at the time of updating this, the repo is already not in sync with the latest API changes. 

We recommend the community to fork this repo in order to maintain the SDK. We'd be more than happy to make a reference on our developer that the developers can use different SDKs build by the community. In case you need to reach out to us, please head over to https://github.com/soundcloud/api/issues

# SoundCloud JavaScript Next

## Setup

- `make setup`

This will install the right node version locally. Please be patient. :)

## Building source

- `make build`

By default, the SDK is built into `build/sdk/sdk-VERSION.js`. Take a look at `webpack.config.js` for details.

### Running with the watcher

This will run webpack with a watcher. The sdk will be rebuilt when you save changes in `src`.

In addition, webpack will start a development server on `http://localhost:8080/`. This serves the files in the `examples/` folder.

- `make run-with-watcher`

### Running without the watcher (custom server)

- `make run`

## Running tests

- `make test`

The test suite uses Karma to execute the tests in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari if available.
